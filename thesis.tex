%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

\begin{abstract}
  On September 14th, 2015 LIGO detected gravitational waves from a merging binary black hole. Just under two years later, LIGO detected gravitational waves from merging neutron stars in coincidence with detections of a gamma ray burst and kilonova. Many more detections of this kind are expected in the future. There are several problems that are facing the numerical relativity community now that binary neutron stars (BNS) have been detected by LIGO and this thesis will tackle two of them. After an introductory chapter to provide the reader with needed background, we present a new numerical scheme and code in Chapter 2 that aims to lay the groundwork for more realistic BNS simulations in the future. This code uses discontinuous Galerkin numerical methods to solve elliptic problems on curvilinear and non-conforming meshes in parallel on large supercomputers. We test this code on several problems in numerical relativity, including one that mimicks the discontinuities in the phase transitions of a Neutron star, as well as the two and three black-hole initial gravitational data problem. This code will be used in the future to obtain highly accurate initial gravitational data for BNS simulations. In Chapter 3 of this thesis, we present a set of twelve new BNS simulations using a current state-of-the-art numerical relativity code. We study the neutrino and matter emission from this set of twelve simulations to establish trends between the source parameters and the emission from the binary. Large sets of simulations of BNS mergers will be crucial for the upcoming LIGO observation runs to maximize the extractions of astrophysical information from the instrument data. Finally in the last chapter we conclude the thesis by overviewing work that is currently being done by collaborators to progress the tools and insights presented in this thesis. 

  %% There are several problems that are facing the numerical relativity community now that binary neutron stars have been detected by LIGO and we will highlight two important ones. To date, there is no code that can simulate binary neutron stars with all of the microphysics known, the complexity and computing power required is just too high. Secondly, there are very few large sets of simulations of merging binary neutron stars with even some of the microphysics included. Having such sets would allow us to analyze the relationship between optical, neutrino and gravitational emissions and the parameters of the binaries. This thesis aims at making progress towards solutions of both these problems. In Chapter 1 of this thesis, we introduce the main concepts to understand the rest of the text. In Chapter 2, we describe a new code we developed to tackle difficult initial data problems in numerical relativity and we show tests of this solver on a problem mimicking Neutron stars with phase transitions and also on multi-black-hole initial data. The future aim of this code will be to solve for binary neutron star initial data with all of the microphysics we can throw at it. In Chapter 3, we describe a large set of binary neutron star simulations we ran using the SpEC code and a state of the art neutrino transport scheme. We study the matter and neutrino emission of these merger simulations across different realistic equations of state and different mass ratios. Finally, in the last chapter we conclude our work and describe ongoing efforts to extend the work done in this thesis.

When I first began my PhD journey, I never would have dreamed that I would be attending the press conference for the first detection of gravitional waves at the Albert Einstein Institute in Hannover, Germany, or that I would later become a member of the Nobel prize-winning LIGO collaboration. For this and many other things, I have to give a big thank you to my supervisor Professor Harald Pfeiffer. Harald not only gave me the opportunity to research within one of the most exciting fields currently in astrophysics, but provided me with multiple opportunities to present my research abroad. He also gave me the opportunity to attend several summer schools and work overseas at the Albert Einstein Institute in Golm, Potsdam. On top of all of this, Harald has helped me get through multiple tough problems that arose in my research and provided the initial ideas for the projects in this thesis.
 
Secondly, thank you to Professor Francois Foucart who taught me how to run and analyze binary neutron stars simulations with the neutrino transport scheme in the Spectral Einstein Code. Chapter 3 of this thesis would not be possible without his knowledge, support and constant help with debugging the (seemingly) hundreds of problems that cropped up while running these simulations.

Thirdly, thank you to my committee members Professor Charles Dyer and Professor Amar Vutha who provided me excellent advice both during the committee meeting and outside of our formal meetings. I still miss the General Relativity class parties at Prof. Dyer's house.

Fourthly, thank you to Krystyna Biel for helping me with all the logistical duties required throughout the PhD, her understanding, thoughtfulness and efficiency was greatly appreciated. 

Lastly, a big thank you to my family, the constant support of my dad, mother, sister and grandad, and the great friends I made in and outside the physics department at the U of T during my PhD: Gunjan Lakhlani, Nazim Boudjada, Amir Abdul-Reda, Daniel Dick, Heather Fong, Adam Lewis, Nick Tacik, Alex Kostenko, Helen Baxter, Daniel Baker, Fang Xi Lin, Phil Berger, George Stein, Dana Simard, Claire Yu, Mubdi Rahman, Julien Dyer, Alex Bercik, Hannah Fronenberg, Luca Talamo and Peter Pangarov and out of town friends Jonah Miller, Nils Deppe, Paul Sarte, Nils Fischer, Stephen Green, Peter Zimmerman, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Sergei Ossokine, Roland Haas, Tim Dietrich. These people made the PhD journey unforgettable and I thank them all for the great times.
