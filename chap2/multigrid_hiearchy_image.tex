  \label{fig:vcycle}
  A structural representation of a multigrid v-cycle. The nodes in yellow are actual grid-levels, while the nodes in blue represent surrogate grids which are not necessarily 2:1 balanced. In order for a multigrid v-cycle to represent a symmetric operation, the grid levels along the down arrow are exactly the same as the grid-levels along the up arrow. Level 0 represents the coarsest possible mesh.}
